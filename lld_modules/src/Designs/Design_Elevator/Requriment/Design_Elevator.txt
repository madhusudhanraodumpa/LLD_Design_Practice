Elevator Design :

● Users should be able to call an elevator at a particular floor.
● Users should be able to go to the desired floor.
● Elevators should accept multiple requests at a time and should
try to fulfill all those requests in an optimal way.
● Gates should open/close. - Time should be configurable
● Start/Stop elevator
● Emergency Button → Elevator should come to the closest
floor.
● Display Board on elevator
● Can go in the maintenance mode
● Light/Fan → Auto mode.
● Limited capacity for the elevator

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
There can be multiple floors

There can be more than one elevator

Elevators can be added or removed(for maintenance) as needed.

Two types of requests to be considered-

i. Person on the floor pressing the UP/DOWN button to call the elevator

ii. Person in the elevator pressing the floor number button to reach a destination

The algorithm for calling the elevator should be dynamic.

The functional algorithm for the elevator should also be dynamic
